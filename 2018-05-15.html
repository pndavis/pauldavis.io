            <p>My campus pastor recently told me, “It feels like you’ve been sleepwalking the last two years and have finally woken up!” when talking about my growth in college. </p>

            <p>Going into college I was spiritually dead – I lived solely to satisfy myself. Yet, through sound teachings and the patient love of friends and family, my faith has become the life-giving center of my world. The journey began seemingly not long ago, as many of you were sending me your best wishes as I began college, leading me to now, a graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a BA in computer science. I’m excited to also include you in this new journey, as I start the next academic year as an intern with <a href="http://www.ruf.org"><b>Reformed University Fellowship (RUF)</b></a>. Reformed University Fellowship is the college ministry of the Presbyterian Church in America and is on over 140 campuses around the nation. The ministry’s mission, and now my mission, is to reach students with the gospel of Jesus Christ and equip them to serve Him, not just on their campus, but in all of life.</p>

            <a href="#">

            </a>
            
            <p>RUF (roughly pronounced R-U-F) up until this point has been monumentally important in helping me find myself in a firm faith. It served as a warm place to struggle with my skeptical mind and doubtful heart. It fostered a caring community that modeled God’s unconditional love and grace towards me. Within the context of this community, my biggest adversaries of doubt and of selfishness began to break down, freeing me to finally start living an other-focused life. Therefore, RUF has helped me realize what it means to live in a body of believers and how that enables a person to live a radically transformed life of servanthood and joy. This internship with RUF will furthermore allow me to practice these realizations in doing ministry while also serving as a testing ground for me to explore ministry vocationally; something I’m sure would have surprised freshman Paul who was set on becoming a software developer. </p>

            <p>I have been placed at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA for the 2018-20 school years. I will be working alongside the campus pastor, Drew Burdette, who has been doing ministry there for the past 6 years. There are many commonalities between the University of Washington and the University of Pittsburgh, so in many ways I will be able to build upon what I have learned about doing ministry on a large secular urban campus environment. I am really thrilled to be doing ministry for the college demographic, as I have found them to be extremely curious and open to having deeper conversations. </p>

            <p>Being an intern with RUF involves a lot of different responsibilities. My primary focus will be connecting to students and connecting students to others. Throughout my time as a student at RUF, I was always amazed by the community fostered. We had quite a few people of other religions simply there because of how well they were loved. Helping create this intentional and loving community will be my first goal. Running parallel, I will be enrolled in a study program reading through the Bible and other books. Additional responsibilities include coordinating social events, planning conferences, meeting with my ordained campus minister, and leading small group Bible studies.</p>

            <p>As I move forward, I am hoping you will walk alongside me in support on my new journey. The first and most important step I’d like to take with you is asking for your prayers. Please pray that I adjust and transition well as I move to a new environment. Pray for the students on campus that I will be directly and indirectly involved with. Prayer for the ministry, for Drew, the campus minister, and for his family. Secondly, intern salaries and expenses are raised completely through financial gifts from individuals and churches, and I hope that you would please prayerfully consider supporting my work with RUF.

            <p>Thank you for partnering with me in this journey ahead. I am so excited to see what God has in store for me. I would love to talk personally about the way God has been working in my life and what my ministry in Washington will look like.
